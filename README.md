### Machine Learning Algorithm & Model Used
For the scikit-learn implementation, the model I decided to use was a pipeline for polynomial interpolation using ridge regression. 
This is the ideal linear model to use given the fact that traffic plot points typically are arranged in a polynomial function manner.
